# PuzzleSolver

The goal of the project is to implement a program that will solve arbitrary tiling puzzles and introduce a rich branch of discrete mathematics / combinatorics that involves tilings, symmetry, counting, solution space searching, branch-and-bound pruning. Brute force search was done initially. To further optimize the algorithm and avoids dead-ends and non-feasible choices, we adopt algorithm X ( a recursive non-deterministic depth first searching with backtracking algorithm for exact cover problem) and dancing links for our searching.
